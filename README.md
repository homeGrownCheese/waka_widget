# Waka Stats Widget


## Info
This is a Scriptable widget I put together using a few other variations from the Scriptable gallery.  If you have coded for the day you will see the daily stats, and if not the weekly stats will be shown.

### How to use

- Download Scriptable
- Sign up at [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/)
- Get API key from account info
- Change username and API key in script
